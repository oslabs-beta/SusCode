## About the Extension

### Background Info

VS Code extensions should come with varying levels of access depending on their functionality. For example, ones designed for thematic purposes should have minimal access, while others that analyze files to assist developers might require more extensive permissions. Thus extensions are granted a broad range of permissions.

Although it's best practice for developers to adhere to the principle of least privilege when building extensions, some may exploit these permissions to access sensitive data from users who install malicious extensions unknowingly. This risk is compounded by the fact that extensions can update their codebase without notifying users. As a result, an extension that was initially benign could later become malicious after an update.

### Our Solution

SusCode is a VScode extension built to help users take the security of their extensions into their own hands. SusCode counteracts both the lack of an extensive permissions protocol and the low threshold for extension security in Microsoft‚Äôs Visual Studio Marketplace by searching through your already downloaded extensions and making you aware of patterns, packages, and requests that could increase an extension‚Äôs vulnerability to malicious attacks or an extension's own potential malicious activity. SusCode stands out as the first application meeting this need within the VScode community.


## How it Works

When you download an extension for VScode, that extension‚Äôs source code is stored on your local device. SusCode then does the following to bring potential vulnerabilities to your attention:

- Provides a list of your installed extensions, you can then choose which extension(s) you want to scan.
- Reads the files in the locally stored extension and scans for certain code patterns. SusCode searches specifically for patterns that can introduce vulnerabilities or are traditionally associated with malicious activity because they often allow the execution of arbitrary code or the insertion of content in a way that is hard to control.
- For each extension you select, Suscode provides a brief description of the extension (grabbed from it‚Äôs own ReadMe.md!) and displays the frequency of each pattern found.
- SusCode also scans these files for potential requests to external sources and displays a direct link to the exact location in the code where the request is being made. This is important as it allows you to understand what sort of remote connections your extensions are making, potentially informing you of unsanctioned telemetry or other malicious requests.
- SusCode also grabs a list of dependencies required by each extension found in its package.json file and runs it through the Open Source Vulnerabilities (OSV) API and displays the results along with a link to vulnerbility details listed in the GitHub Security Advisory database. This schema has been adopted by many vulnerability databases including GitHub Security Advisories, PyPA, RustSec, and many more.

## Initial Setup & Installation

- Once downloading and installing the extension from Visual Studio Marketplace, you're good to go.

  <p align="start">
  <img src="src/assets/demo_activate.png"/>
  </p>

- SusCode will appear as a magnifying glass icon in your activity bar:

  <p align="start">
  <img src="src/assets/magnifying-glass.png" height= "50" width= "50"/>

- To activate the extension, simply click on that icon. This icon was provided by [icons8](https://icons8.com/).

- You will then be able to select the extensions you would like to scan:

  <p align="start">
  <img src="src/assets/demo_sidebar.png" height= "250" width= "auto"/>
  </p>

- A window will open and display the results for each extension in its own tab.
